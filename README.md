I've already implemented the link using pattern strategy, but i think i still have to do smth with classes using this strategies (now there is only one such class in project - GoingCircle) to achieve polymorphism and oblige such classes actually use my strategy. Now I have similar interfaces (one for each concrete strategy) with IAction (my strategy interface) property and method which supposes to use it. The problem is this property is public but i need it to be private. Well, and there are many similar interfaces - seems not good.  Also some properties can't be private. I solved this in one of master commits just removed actors' interfaces. Nevertheless, a major problem of this solution is it's obvious overcomplexity.
